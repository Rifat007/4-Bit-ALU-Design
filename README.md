# 4-Bit-ALU-Design
Schematic design of 4-Bit ALU

4-bit ALU Design Specification

Required Flags:

• Carry

• Sign

• Overflow

• Zero

Design and Implementation Issues:
• All outputs and flag status must be directed to LED.
• Flags will be affected as per the rules of Assembly Language.
• Any SSI (AND, OR, NOT, XOR etc.) and MSI (MUX, Decoder, Adder etc.) chip can be used.
• Emphasis should be given on efficiency of design and minimization of ICs used.
• Late submission will result in reduced marking.
• For simulation you can use any software (like Proteus).
• While demonstration you must bring your group specification.
